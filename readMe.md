# Credit Wise Loan System

A mid-sized financial company named Secure Trust Bank offers personal and home loans to customers across urban and rural regions of India. Every day, hundreds of customers apply for loans through online and branch applications. Until now, Secure Trust Bank has been using a process where loan officers evaluate applications by checking income proofs, employment details, credit history, and other documents. This process is time-consuming, biased, and inconsistent.

As a result of the manual verification process, the bank faces two major challenges:

1. Leading to loss of business, good customers sometimes get rejected.
2. Leading to financial losses, high-risk customers sometimes get approved.

To solve this problem, the bank wants to introduce an intelligent system powered by Machine Learning that can automatically analyse applicant details before final human verification. The intelligent loan approval system predicts whether a loan should be Approved or Rejected.

You are hired as a data scientist to design and develop this intelligent system using historical loan application data. The system must learn hidden patterns from previous customer records and provide accurate, fast, and unbiased loan approval decisions.
